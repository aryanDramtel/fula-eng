Pulaar-English Dictionary (Fouta Djallon Dialect)
This is a collection of Pulaar-English word translations, focusing on the Fouta Djallon dialect spoken in Guinea. Pulaar is a widely spoken language across West Africa, but every region has its own way of speaking it. The Fouta Djallon dialect is quite different from the ones spoken in Senegal, Mali, or Nigeria, both in pronunciation and vocabulary.

Why This Project?
Finding good resources for this dialect was surprisingly difficult. Most of what's available online is either incomplete, inconsistent, or based on other dialects. Even now, some of the words in this list might not be 100% accurate. Pulaar speakers in Guinea don’t always have the same words as those in other countries, and there aren’t many standardized dictionaries for this specific dialect.

How You Can Help
Since this was put together from various sources, there’s a chance that some translations need fixing. If you’re a native speaker or know Pulaar well—especially the Fouta Djallon dialect—your help would be greatly appreciated! Whether it’s correcting words, adding new ones, or even just giving feedback, every contribution makes this more useful.

If you want to help, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
